    <p>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</p>
    <p>by Agatha Christie</p>
  <div type="chapter">
    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
    <head type="subtitle">I GO TO STYLES</head>
    <p>The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as &quot;The Styles Case&quot; has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist.</p>
    <p>I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair.</p>
    <p>I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month&apos;s sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayed at Styles, his mother&apos;s place in Essex.</p>
    <p>We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there.</p>

    <p>I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who had married John&apos;s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable fortune of her own.</p>
    <p>Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife&apos;s ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the time of their father&apos;s remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother.</p>
    <p>Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any marked success.</p>
    <p>John practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home of his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.</p>
    <p>John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother&apos;s remarriage and smiled rather ruefully.</p>

    <p>Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the car.</p>

    <p>The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:</p>

    <p>Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet to match   these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation, I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.</p>

    <p>said John.</p>
    <p>I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall, slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman&apos;s that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed, which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body   all these things are burnt into my memory. I shall never forget them.</p>
    <p>She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John&apos;s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.</p>
    <p>At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French window near at hand:</p>

    <p>I looked with some curiosity at &quot;Alfred darling&quot;. He certainly struck a rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out of place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He placed a wooden hand in mine and said:</p>

    <p>She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman!</p>
    <p>With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp, however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.</p>
    <p>Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice:</p>

    <p>impatiently, and the girl started and ran back to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John&apos;s younger brother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face.</p>
    <p>Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs.</p>
    <p>The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.</p>
    <p>The next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit.</p>
    <p>I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods, returning to the house about five.</p>
    <p>As we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the smoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.</p>

    <p>he broke off, frowning.</p>
    <p>For the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt security. Now that security was removed   and the air seemed rife with suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my mind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.</p>
    <head type="subtitle">CHAPTER II.</head>
    <p>THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY</p>
    <p>I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as possible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations.</p>
    <p>I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging me to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be reconciled.</p>
    <p>The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish&apos;s extraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the society of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine, but she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for long expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to see his attraction.</p>
    <p>The 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous bazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection with the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War poem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take place. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden. I noticed that John&apos;s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed very excited and restless.</p>
    <p>After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts in the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.</p>
    <p>About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be late as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the door.</p>
    <p>The entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s recitation receiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which Cynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been acting with her in the tableaux.</p>
    <p>The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as she was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about 12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.</p>

    <p>Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr. Bauerstein.</p>
    <p>We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp replied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters to write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia in the pony-trap.</p>
    <p>We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily addressed as &quot;Nibs.</p>

    <p>I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared to John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was the opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually shy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for him. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather constrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him. But they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like a couple of children.</p>
    <p>As we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some stamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.</p>
    <p>As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just entering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud exclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.</p>

    <p>Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a detective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.</p>
    <p>He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow Belgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he raised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.</p>

    <p>I was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen. Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could not dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish&apos;s concern in the matter?</p>
    <p>Mr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck me afresh.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was unusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little attentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the part of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp retired to her boudoir again.</p>

    <p>John rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s door violently, but with no effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole household was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.</p>

    <p>We strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid, and for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it give beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was burst open.</p>
    <p>We stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs. Inglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent convulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon the pillows.</p>
    <p>John strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of the housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy. Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave on the corridor.</p>
    <p>I turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on my lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man&apos;s face. He was white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or some such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned him to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I could see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely harmless enough.</p>
    <p>The violence of Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s attack seemed to be passing. She was able to speak in short gasps.</p>

    <p>A shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing near the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting the girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was heavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.</p>

    <p>said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear voice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock. Then it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o&apos;clock.</p>
    <p>A strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless to help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched in an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer more brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that peculiar fashion.</p>
    <p>At that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the room. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the bed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled voice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:</p>

    <p>Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.</p>
    <p>With a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked them energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration. He issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave of his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated, though I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that nothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face that he himself had little hope.</p>
    <p>Finally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that moment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s own doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.</p>
    <p>In a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be passing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the house as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins. With a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.</p>

    <p>The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I, accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me. It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain his absence?</p>

    <p>After which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.</p>
    <p>A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the writing-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar, however. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted wire through the handle.</p>
    <p>Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door opposite leading into Cynthia&apos;s room. That door was also bolted, as I had stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.</p>
    <p>On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it.</p>
    <p>I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this. Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.</p>

    <p>I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good asking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went on with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one, very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment&apos;s hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own pocket.</p>

How she would have gaped if she had realized that her &quot;coarse kitchen salt was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I marvelled at Poirot&apos;s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited his next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.</p>

    <p>I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive type of mind.</p>
    <p>Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.</p>

    <p>Everyone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we were naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is always trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as usual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really a matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of secretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy.</p>
    <p>I pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that we suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the fact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear, or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked man.</p>
    <p>But did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In her soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her slender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent, hardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the great strength of her personality was dominating us all.</p>
    <p>And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I thought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:</p>

    <p>I followed John&apos;s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang of guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon, and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She had known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would the man have feared her watchful eyes?</p>
    <p>I was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered painful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful; that she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.</p>

    <p>It occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss Howard and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace between them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy John. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully appreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought refuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.</p>
    <p>Dorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over from the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss Howard.</p>

    <p>I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I could hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one, doubted the wisdom.

    <p>We had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his own room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary annoyance vanished.</p>
    <p>Poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant. It was going to be a hot day.</p>
    <p>Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that was extraordinary   a curious mingling of terror and agitation.</p>

    <p>I endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.</p>
    <p>Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let Alfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_   when a word from me could save him!</p>

    <p>In the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his activity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks into the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was driving at.</p>
    <p>It occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes&apos;s farm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on Wednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet him. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to the farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at me cunningly.</p>

    <p>I walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I experienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred Inglethorp&apos;s liberality with another woman&apos;s money. Had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser mainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.</p>
    <p>On one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or twice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it was four-thirty, and not four o&apos;clock when she had heard the voices.</p>
    <p>But Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed between the time when she had heard the voices and five o&apos;clock, when she had taken tea to her mistress.</p>
    <p>The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village. Poirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.</p>
    <p>The preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John Cavendish gave evidence of identification.</p>
    <p>Further questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of the morning, and the circumstances of his mother&apos;s death.</p>
    <p>The medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and every eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology.</p>
    <p>In a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn of its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact that Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine poisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one grain or slightly over.</p>

    <p>But Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that possibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary, Mrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.</p>
    <p>So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner proceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress&apos;s bell, and had subsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the quarrel on the preceding afternoon.</p>
    <p>Dorcas&apos;s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had already heard, so I will not repeat it here.</p>
    <p>The next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the Coroner&apos;s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at four-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the sound of something heavy falling.</p>

    <p>I did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the two detectives waiting for us below.</p>
    <p>Poirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and, carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned me to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and set out for Styles.</p>
    <p>I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a shock   especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had realized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could have done.</p>
    <p>Poirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was the latter functionary who requested that the household, with the exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the drawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot to make his boast good.</p>
    <p>Personally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for his belief in Inglethorp&apos;s innocence, but a man of the type of Summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot could supply.</p>
    <p>Before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of which Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a tangible reality. We had read of such things   now we ourselves were actors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England, would blazon out the news in staring headlines:</p>
    <p>MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX</p>
    <p>WEALTHY LADY POISONED</p>
    <p>There would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of &quot;The family leaving the Inquest&quot;   the village photographer had not been idle! All the things that one had read a hundred times   things that happen to other people, not to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In front of us were &quot;the detectives in charge of the case.&quot; The well-known glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before Poirot opened the proceedings.</p>
    <p>I think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative.</p>

    <p>And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.</p>
    <p>This proceeding of Poirot&apos;s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my confidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully restored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp&apos;s innocence had been so triumphantly vindicated.</p>
    <p>The funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on Monday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and informed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up his quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his plans.</p>

    <p>In the general relief at Inglethorp&apos;s approaching departure, we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia, whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the opening of a new and hopeful future.</p>
    <p>The papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines, sandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle innuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue. Nothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in fashionable life: &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; was the topic of the moment.</p>
    <p>Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was constantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied admission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds, where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the household. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men came and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes?</p>
    <p>After breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if she might have a few words with me.</p>

    <p>Poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There were one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his head over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as though he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an exclamation.</p>

    <p>I had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot&apos;s message to Lawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a grudge against my friend&apos;s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about, with a still more ancient mallet.</p>
    <p>It struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message. Otherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I did not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by Lawrence&apos;s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted him.</p>

    <p>The woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the open park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades. There was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was faint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were kindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In fact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.</p>
    <p>I thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and far off.</p>
    <p>I yawned again.</p>
    <p>Probably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a bad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had murdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of John to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out:</p>

    <p>At once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about twelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing each other, and they were evidently quarrelling.

    <p>I admitted reluctantly.</p>
    <p>And then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at him. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief, for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that Dr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.</p>
    <p>Yet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary Cavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to poison.</p>
    <p>And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a woman&apos;s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday evening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and Bauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed?</p>
    <p>Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and Evelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?</p>
    <p>Yes, it all fitted in.</p>
    <p>No wonder Miss Howard had suggested &quot;hushing it up.&quot; Now I understood that unfinished sentence of hers: &quot;Emily herself      &quot; And in my heart I agreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of Cavendish.</p>

    <p>Her glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred to me to wonder about the girl&apos;s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would probably insist on her making her home with them   at any rate until the end of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry to let her go.</p>
    <p>John, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.</p>

    <p>I waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.</p>
    <head type="subtitle">CHAPTER X.</head>
    <head type="subtitle">THE ARREST</head>
    <p>To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.</p>
    <p>I was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier?</p>
    <p>I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I was uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in all probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not resolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the arrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not be a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any suspicions of her. She could not be implicated   otherwise I should have heard some hint of it.</p>
    <p>Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to conceal Dr. Bauerstein&apos;s arrest from her. It would be announced in every newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If only Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What possessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?</p>
    <p>In spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably heightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not Poirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.</p>
    <p>After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and leave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.</p>
    <p>He gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.</p>

    <p>But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest! There was a column of mere padding about &quot;The Styles Poisoning Case, but nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that, for some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrests to come.</p>
    <p>After breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot had returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked one of the windows, and the well-known voice said:</p>

    <p>And she walked quietly past me out of the window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.</p>
    <p>No, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her part with that icy unconcern.</p>
    <p>Poirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was no sign of the Scotland Yard men.</p>
    <p>But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence   or rather lack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which Mrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our efforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that it might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen, in the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from a firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s cheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means of Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be abandoned.</p>
    <p>Just before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new disappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.</p>

    <p>All the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me that in some way she was nervous of Poirot&apos;s eyes.</p>
    <p>The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports coat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like some great giant sighing.</p>
    <p>We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong.</p>
    <p>Dorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her hands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background, all eyes and ears.</p>

    <p>Of the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself passionately on her husband&apos;s side, scorning the mere idea of his guilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.</p>

    <p>I was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed on to John what I believed to be Poirot&apos;s views concerning Bauerstein. He, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him. Nevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings were pretty well clipped for the future.</p>
    <p>I asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my intense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely likely to be acquitted.</p>

    <p>Poirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police court proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was duly committed for trial.</p>
    <p>September found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington, Poirot being included in the family party.</p>
    <p>I myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see them continually.</p>
    <p>As the weeks went by, the state of Poirot&apos;s nerves grew worse and worse. That &quot;last link&quot; he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I hoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary, if John were not acquitted?</p>
    <p>On September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey, charged with &quot;The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,&quot; and pleaded &quot;Not Guilty.</p>
    <p>Sir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend him.</p>
    <p>Mr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.</p>
    <p>The murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother. Ever since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had lived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and attention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.</p>
    <p>He proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate and spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a neighbouring farmer&apos;s wife. This having come to his stepmother&apos;s ears, she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel ensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner had purchased strychnine at the village chemist&apos;s shop, wearing a disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon another man   to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s husband, of whom he had been bitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to produce an unimpeachable alibi.</p>
    <p>On the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the quarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in favour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour before her marriage, but   and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive forefinger   the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the deceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could not say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the former one; or   this seemed to him more likely   she may have had an idea that it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some conversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in legal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in favour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal night. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on which occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the will which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour valid.</p>
    <p>The prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his room, by Detective Inspector Japp   a most brilliant officer   of the identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village chemist&apos;s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder. It would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner&apos;s guilt.</p>
    <p>And, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite unthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.</p>
    <p>The first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been called at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.</p>
    <p>Sir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two questions.</p>

    <p>Mr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him to &quot;Mr. Inglethorp.&quot; Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr. Inglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not cross-examined.</p>
    <p>Alfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison. He also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses testified to the accuracy of these statements.</p>
    <p>The gardeners&apos; evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken, and then Dorcas was called.</p>
    <p>Dorcas, faithful to her &quot;young gentlemen,&quot; denied strenuously that it could have been John&apos;s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the teeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the boudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the face of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to give evidence against her husband.</p>
    <p>After various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:</p>

    <p>An assistant from Parkson&apos;s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on June 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as requested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed. No, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in their books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to &quot;L. Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court.</p>

    <p>The witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest signified that he was satisfied.</p>
    <p>Elizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead of leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a slight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and had seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s door.</p>
    <p>Sir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down again with a satisfied smile on his face.</p>
    <p>With the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the proceedings were adjourned until the following day.</p>

    <p>The phial was that already recognized by the chemist&apos;s assistant, a tiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white crystalline powder, and labelled: &quot;Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.</p>
    <p>A fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police court proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It had been found in Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s cheque book, and on being reversed at a mirror, showed clearly the words: &quot;. . . erything of which I die possessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...&quot; This placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased lady&apos;s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of paper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the beard in the attic, completed his evidence.</p>

    <p>More evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in which the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to his intrigue with Mrs. Raikes   poor Mary, that must have been bitter hearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her facts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.</p>
    <p>Lawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer to Mr. Philips&apos; questions, he denied having ordered anything from Parkson&apos;s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in Wales.</p>

    <p>This bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid together, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate silence.</p>
    <p>There was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called upon for their opinion of the signature of &quot;Alfred Inglethorp&quot; in the chemist&apos;s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was certainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might be that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that it might be the prisoner&apos;s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.</p>
    <p>Sir Ernest Heavywether&apos;s speech in opening the case for the defence was not a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic manner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically unproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it impartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the prisoner&apos;s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed out, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson&apos;s. The quarrel which had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely admitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly exaggerated.</p>
    <p>His learned friend   Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips   had stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come forward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr. Inglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought the facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this. The prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr. and Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner&apos;s head that anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr. Inglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two quarrels.</p>
    <p>The prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had entered the chemist&apos;s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp. The prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called Marston&apos;s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note, couched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner had, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced as evidence.</p>
    <p>As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the prisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically revoked by his stepmother&apos;s remarriage. He would call evidence to show who did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case.</p>
    <p>Finally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against other people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to the fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as strong, if not stronger than that against his brother.</p>
    <p>He would now call the prisoner.</p>
    <p>John acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest&apos;s skilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous note received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine. The readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and the disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.</p>
    <p>At the close of his examination, he paused, and said:</p>

    <p>Poirot&apos;s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning wore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o&apos;clock a ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see Poirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The little man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed with exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.</p>

To begin with, the fragment corresponds\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish&apos;s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish&apos;s door. I myself, in company\nwith the police, went to the deceased&apos;s room, and whilst there I,\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\nthe tragedy.

      <s said="direct">"<hi rend="italic">Bon!</hi> I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp&apos;s large sized\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot&apos;s? The risk is practically\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\nclever   and that was their undoing."</s>
