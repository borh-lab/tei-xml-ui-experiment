    <p>The Science of Deduction</p>
    <p>Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.</p>
    <p>Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer.</p>

    <p>I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion s quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.</p>

He has all\nthe Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide\nrange of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments\nof his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some\nfeatures of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,\nthe one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have\nsuggested to him the true solution.

      <s said="direct">"Yes, I have been guilty of\nseveral monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for\nexample, is one  Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various\nTobaccoes.  In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-,\ncigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating the\ndifference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in\ncriminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a\nclue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been\ndone by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows\nyour field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference\nbetween the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of\nbird s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato."</s>

    <p>I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens.

    <p>The Statement of the Case</p>
    <p>Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means. The dress was a sombre greyish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation.</p>

    <p>He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.</p>
    <p>It was a September evening, and not yet seven o clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light, sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan s manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.</p>
    <p>At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.</p>

    <p>He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. she answered.</p>
    <p>He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets.</p>
    <p>The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax, which was an inconceivable hypothesis, or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets.</p>

    <p>We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings, the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house.</p>

    <head type="subtitle">Chapter IV</head>
    <p>The Story of the Bald-Headed Man</p>
    <p>We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill-lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year.</p>

    <p>We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.</p>

    <p>Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face.</p>

Among other things, he found that the height of the\nbuilding was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of\nall the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space\nbetween, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total\nto more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These\ncould only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore,\nin the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure\nenough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been\nsealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the\ntreasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the\nhole, and there it lies.

    <p>At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.</p>

    <p>The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge</p>
    <p>It was nearly eleven o clock when we reached this final stage of our night s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.</p>
    <p>Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.</p>

    <p>We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.</p>
    <p>Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us.</p>

    <p>Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto s teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.</p>
    <p>The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.</p>

    <p>I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face, the very face of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.</p>

    <p>he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto s chamber.</p>
    <p>It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odour. A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.</p>
    <p>By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument, a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me.</p>

The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam.

    <p>He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defence. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.</p>

    <head type="subtitle">Chapter VII</head>
    <p>The Episode of the Barrel</p>
    <p>The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping, so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If Holmes s researches were successful, she would be an heiress. Was it fair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.</p>
    <p>It was nearly two o clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester s. The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other s waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an honoured friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall-light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.</p>
    <p>And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter, we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto s death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan s chart, here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.</p>
    <p>Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.</p>

    <p>He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers.</p>
    <p>Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in colour, with a very clumsy waddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective s name.</p>

    <p>He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog s nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the _bouquet_ of a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel s collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.</p>
    <p>The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold grey light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it.</p>
    <p>On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side.</p>

He comes to England with the double\nidea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having\nhis revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto\nlived, and very possibly he established communications with some one\ninside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen.\nMrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not\nfind out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew,\nsave the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small\nlearns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret\nof the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes\nhis way to the dying man s window, and is only deterred from entering\nby the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the\ndead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in\nthe hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and\nfinally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the\ncard. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major\nhe would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not\na common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates,\nsomething in the nature of an act of justice.

    <p>We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where labourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.</p>
    <p>We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where the latter street turns into Knight s Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment.</p>

Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote.</p>
    <p>Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.</p>

    <p>It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf.

    <p>Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. &quot;Mordecai Smith&quot; was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, &quot;Boats to hire by the hour or day.&quot; A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept, a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression.</p>

    <p>It was between eight and nine o clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure, however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.</p>
    <p>A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee.</p>

    <p>I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.</p>
    <p>About twelve o clock last night,&quot; said the _Standard_, &quot;Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto s person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralised, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.</p>

    <p>The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained.</p>

    <p>They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.</p>

    <p>He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air, his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation. I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow. Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dreamland, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me.</p>

    <p>I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist s in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night s adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto s death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them.</p>

    <p>We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.</p>

    <p>I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the _Standard_, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business. &quot;With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,&quot; it remarked, we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment.</p>

    <p>I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way:</p>
    <p>Lost. Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith s Wharf at or about three o clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch _Aurora_, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith s Wharf, or at 221_b_ Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch _Aurora_.</p>
    <p>This was clearly Holmes s doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.</p>
    <p>It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion s reasoning. Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic, his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes s explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally _outr _ and startling.</p>
    <p>At three o clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.</p>

    <p>A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a coloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long grey side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.</p>

    <p>The End of the Islander</p>
    <p>Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of subjects, on miracle-plays, on medi val pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of the future, handling each as though he had made a special study of it. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a _bon vivant_. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes s gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.</p>
    <p>When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port.</p>

      <s said="direct">"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical\nanalysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work\nis the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the\nhydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the\nSholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up\nthe river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any\nlanding-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have\nbeen scuttled to hide their traces, though that always remained as a\npossible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a\ncertain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of\nanything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product\nof higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been\nin London some time as we had evidence that he maintained a continual\nwatch over Pondicherry Lodge he could hardly leave at a moment s\nnotice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to\narrange his affairs.

      <s said="direct">"No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a\nretreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he\ncould do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan\nSmall must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,\nhowever much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and\npossibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp\nenough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under\ncover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad\nlight. Now, it was past three o clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when\nthey got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about\nin an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They\npaid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final\nescape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a\ncouple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,\nand whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under\ncover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no\ndoubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the\nColonies."</s>

      <s said="direct">"Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite\nof its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and\nlooked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider\nthat to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make\npursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then,\ncould he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I\nwondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only\nthink of one way of doing it. I might land the launch over to some\nboat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in\nher. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be\neffectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few\nhours  notice."</s>

    <p>At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the _Aurora_ had gained a good two hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty _Aurora_. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat s lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a little black man the smallest I have ever seen with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.</p>

    <p>There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.</p>
    <head type="subtitle">Chapter XI</head>
    <p>The Great Agra Treasure</p>
    <p>Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with grey. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes.</p>

    <p>They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour s drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.</p>
    <p>She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.</p>

    <p>There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!</p>
    <p>No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completely empty.</p>

      <s said="direct">"Well, I was never in luck s way long. Suddenly, without a note of\nwarning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still\nand peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were\ntwo hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a\nperfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen, a deal more\nthan I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what\nI saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra,\nnear the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole\nsky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had\nsmall companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their\nwives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest\ntroops. Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that\nthe affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as\nsuddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking\nwhiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze\nabout him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife,\nused to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash\ncame. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly\nhome in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled\ntogether at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it\nwas, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson s\nwife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs.\nA little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face,\nquite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying\nacross each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering\nwhich way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling\nup from Abel White s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through\nthe roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would\nonly throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I\nstood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats\nstill on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some\nof them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I\nbroke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe\nwithin the walls at Agra."</s>

We were short-handed, with hardly men\nenough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was\nimpossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of\nthe innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a central\nguard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the\ncharge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to\ntake charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door\nupon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed\nunder my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire\nmy musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central\nguard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as\nthe space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and\ncorridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time\nto be of any use in case of an actual attack."</s>

    <p>No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to say.</p>
    <p>There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger, with the Sepoy and with the Company s Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men s day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders. By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt.</p>
    <p>This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort. He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming. The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it, Sahib?</p>

Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.

There were one hundred and forty-three\ndiamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I\nbelieve,  the Great Mogul  and is said to be the second largest stone\nin existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one\nhundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There\nwere forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates,\nand a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats -eyes, turquoises, and\nother stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time,\nthough I have become more familiar with them since.

This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out\nof his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him\nthat night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought\nhe had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there\nhimself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him\nso strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought\nit to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made,\nand the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought\nthat all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a\ncharge of murder, three of us because we had held the gate that night,\nand the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the\nmurdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for\nthe rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any\nparticular interest in them.

His\nuncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he\ncould stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over\nto Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the\ntreasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without\ncarrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret.\nFrom that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I\nnursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with\nme. I cared nothing for the law, nothing for the gallows.

But it was weary years before my time came.\nI have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day\nwhen Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was\npicked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had\ngone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as\nvenomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all\nright and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would\nhardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I\nlearned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the\nfonder of me."</s>

      <s said="direct">"He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more\nfaithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As it\nchanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there, a vile\nPathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I\nhad always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate\nhad placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the\nisland. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on\nhis shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with,\nbut none could I see. Then a queer thought came into my head and showed\nme where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness\nand unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put\nhis carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the\nwhole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now\nwhere I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my\nbalance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made\nfor the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought\nall his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among\nother things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut\nmatting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating\nabout, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a\ntrader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay\npilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle\ndown among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and\nasked no questions."</s>

      <s said="direct">"We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs\nand other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and\ndance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day s\nwork. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some\nyears there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the\ntreasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The\ntreasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr.\nBartholomew Sholto s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look\nat the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make\nmy way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and\nalso about Mr. Sholto s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could\nmanage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a\nlong rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon\nmade his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it,\nBartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he\nhad done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by\nthe rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much\nsurprised was he when I made at him with the rope s end and cursed him\nfor a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it\ndown, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four\nupon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those\nwho had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the\nwindow, and made off the way that he had come."</s>
